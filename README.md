# kinectTest

this is a test program for kinect on vs2015, windows 10. before you run this program you need to:
1. have opencv for your vs2015(i use 3.2.0);
2. have point cloud library for vs2015(http://unanancyowen.com/en/pcl18/, download 64bit vc2015 all-in-one version from this site, all needed libraries are included, and then install them);
3. link your kinect to your computer;
4. create your project in vs2015, add the kinecttest.cpp as main cpp, add props to your project and build it under x64.

this program is from Rongdi Sun(my classmate in the same lab). i put it here to backup.
